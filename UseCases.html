<H3>Overview:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">With the advent of smartphones and other 'connected' wearable devices hosting various health sensors, a revolution in healthcare is in the making; paving the way for realizing endless possibilities such as real-time patient and doctor interaction, assisted care, at-home disease management etc. Economical, patient-centric solutions can now be easily made available thereby promoting general health and wellness of users.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most of the services though are currently limited to the realm of 'native' applications that interact with the health sensors, collate and classify the information and make it available for further consumption.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is estimated that by 2017, there will be 1.4 billion mobile sensing health and fitness app downloads worldwide [1]. Combine these facts with the growing popularity of Web Apps and the Internet of Things fast becoming a reality, and we are left with a gaping need for Web APIs for dealing with Health and Wellness mobile sensing data.

<H3>Proposal:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The <B>contact</B> meta extension defines the vendor's contact information by way of a phone number (such as a customer support number), an e-mail ID (such as the customer support mail ID) or a physical address (such as the office address or billing address). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">UAs displaying a page containing this meta extension could then make this contact information directly available for the user’s perusal.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Often visitors have to hunt through a
vendor's site for obtaining the customer support mail ID, phone
number etc. which is mostly hidden behind a not so prominently
displayed &quot;Help&quot; or &quot;Contact Us&quot; link.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Vendor's specifying their registered
mail ID, phone number and/or their address via this meta extension
can thus expect supporting UAs to present the contact information to the
user in an easily accessible format, either by way of a browser menu
option (such as &quot;mail&quot;, “call”, “map”) or via the
URL bar scheme handler or in another similar format.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Selecting these menu options, if
available, should launch the default mail application with the
specified mail ID, the dialer application with the given contact
number or, the default maps application loaded with the specified
address/location tag respectively.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">No known existing meta extensions with
a similar name/intention exist.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </P>

<H3>Syntax:</H3>
<P class="example"><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;<B>contact</B>&quot;
content=&quot;+1-555-555-5555 abc@xyz.com '5844 South Oak Street, Chicago, Illinois' &quot;&gt;</code></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The content attribute for the
contact meta extension is a space separated string containing the phone-number followed by the e-mail ID and then the address (specified within quotes).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Or</P>
<P class="example"><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;<B>contact</B>&quot;
content=&quot;Chicago: +1-555-555-5555  abc@xyz.com '5844 South Oak Street, Chicago, Illinois'; Brookfield: +1-444-444-4444 def@xyz.com '2341 Cherry Lane, Brookfield, Illinois'; Naperville: +1-333-333-3333 jkl@xyz.com '515 W. Jefferson, Naperville, Illinois 60540'&quot;&gt;</code></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For specifying multiple entries a semi-colon separated list of name: value pairs can be defined. The name can be any descriptive tag identifying the given location.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Valid phone numbers and mail IDs should be provided by the vendor. The address can either be a string specified within quotes or the latitude and longtitude coordinates.</p>
<P class="example"><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;<B>contact</B>&quot;
content=&quot;Chicago: +1-555-555-5555  abc@xyz.com '20.593684;78.96288'; Brookfield: +1-444-444-4444 def@xyz.com '20.593684;78.96288'; Naperville: +1-333-333-3333 jkl@xyz.com '20.593684;78.96288'&quot;&gt;</code></P>

<H3>Use Case (for multiple contact numbers, mail IDs
and addresses):</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We take the example of a banking
website. In case of international banks (e.g. Citibank) we are posed
with the challenge of enlisting all their contact details, spread
across different nations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Vendors mostly maintain granularity at
a national level, redirecting the users to the country specific
website automatically. This would be handled at the server itself
wherein different pages shall be pushed based on the requesting IP.
The website author can thus deliver country specific information to
the users.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, the bank will also have
multiple offices throughout the country and multiple branches within
the same city. The website author shall have to provide all the
information regarding the bank’s various locations and
corresponding customer care numbers and mail IDs. This forms the
basis for having a syntax that is capable of accommodating multiple
entries for contact numbers, mail IDs or addresses.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The UA could list down all the
available options thereby enabling the user to make an informed
choice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An option for filtering the available
options (based on the name) can also be provided to the end user.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>

<H3>Use Case (for geo-fencing):</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Consider the same example of a banking
website wherein the bank has several branches located within the same
city. It would be highly beneficial to the user in such cases if the
UA were to display the nearest branch address based on the user’s
current location.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The user’s location information (if
available) can be retrieved by the UA and the same can then be used
to predict the nearest branch office from the list of the available
offices. Corresponding contact-number too (if available) can be
extracted (if specified with the same ‘name’).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>

<H3><a name="manifest">As part of the Manifest:</a></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Considering the aforementioned use
cases, we are now faced with the possibility of having lengthy
contact number and/or address lists being specified in meta tags.
This would unnecessarily make the markup cumbersome and lengthy. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Instead, we could specify these values
as part of the new json based Manifest
[<A HREF="http://w3c.github.io/manifest/">http://w3c.github.io/manifest/</A>].</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The name-value pairs can easily be
defined in the json format and since the Manifest would ideally not
be updated as often as the main resource it thus offers to be a more
optimal solution.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>

<H3>As an HTML tag:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The contact information can also be provided via an HTML tag: &lt;contact&gt;. As an HTML tag, the complexities arising due to mapping of contact information to a particular location, can be avoided.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>

<H3>Future enhancements:</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Provision for one click, WebRTC based sessions between the client and the vendor, thereby enhancing accessibility.</P>
